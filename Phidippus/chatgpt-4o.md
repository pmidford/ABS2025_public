# **Ethogram of Courtship Behavior in *Phidippus audax***  
*(Order Araneae: Family Salticidae)*

## **Introduction**

*Phidippus audax* is a sexually dimorphic jumping spider species in which males engage in complex, multimodal courtship displays to attract and secure receptive females. Courtship in this species relies heavily on visual and vibratory signaling, with male displays serving both to elicit female receptivity and to mitigate female aggression. The following ethogram catalogs and defines the core components of male courtship behavior, as well as relevant female responses.

---

## **I. Courtship Initiation**

### 1. **Orientation**
- **Definition**: Male visually detects and aligns body toward a female.
- **Description**: Upon visual detection of a conspecific female, the male ceases locomotion, pivots to face the female directly, and begins visual tracking.
- **Modality**: Visual.
- **Function**: Initiates courtship sequence and establishes male awareness of the female.
- **Notes**: Orientation is often the first overt behavior and may occur at distances of several body lengths.

### 2. **Approach**
- **Definition**: Male moves toward female in a slow and deliberate manner.
- **Description**: Males engage in slow, jerky locomotion toward the female, frequently pausing between steps.
- **Modality**: Visual.
- **Function**: Reduces perceived threat; maintains female attention.
- **Notes**: Approaches are often punctuated by exploratory leg raises and subtle body adjustments. If the female retreats, males may pause or re-orient.

---

## **II. Display Phase (Multimodal Courtship)**

### 3. **Leg-Waving (Foreleg Display)**
- **Definition**: Alternating or synchronous elevation and waving of the first pair of legs.
- **Description**: The male raises and waves his enlarged forelegs in rhythmic patterns, often alternating sides or performing synchronous waves.
- **Modality**: Visual.
- **Function**: Enhances visibility; species and sex recognition; may indicate male quality.
- **Notes**: Typically performed while stationary or during slow approach; angle and amplitude of leg waving vary with distance and female behavior.

### 4. **Palpal Drumming**
- **Definition**: Vibratory tapping or movement of pedipalps against the substrate.
- **Description**: Males rhythmically tap their pedipalps on the substrate, producing seismic signals.
- **Modality**: Vibratory (substrate-borne).
- **Function**: Signals male identity and courtship intent; may stimulate female receptivity.
- **Notes**: Often temporally coordinated with leg-waving or body bounces.

### 5. **Abdomen Bouncing (Abdominal Pulsation)**
- **Definition**: Rapid, rhythmic vertical movements of the abdomen.
- **Description**: The male repeatedly lifts and lowers his abdomen while remaining mostly stationary.
- **Modality**: Both vibratory and visual.
- **Function**: Generates substrate vibrations and may serve as a visual enhancer of the courtship display.
- **Notes**: Frequency and intensity may correlate with male condition and motivation.

### 6. **Body Rocking or Swaying**
- **Definition**: Lateral or anteroposterior body movements without forward locomotion.
- **Description**: Males rock their bodies from side to side or shift weight between legs in a slow, deliberate pattern.
- **Modality**: Visual.
- **Function**: Maintains female attention; may exaggerate visual cues of symmetry or vigor.
- **Notes**: Often interspersed with leg waving and palpal drumming.

### 7. **Cheliceral Exposure or Extension**
- **Definition**: Extension of chelicerae outward from the prosoma.
- **Description**: Males may partially expose or extend their chelicerae, sometimes accompanied by palpal movement.
- **Modality**: Visual (and potentially chemical via close-range cues).
- **Function**: May play a role in species recognition or assessment of male threat level.
- **Notes**: Not always observed; may be more common in agonistic or ambiguous interactions.

---

## **III. Female Response Behaviors**

### 8. **Stationary Acceptance Posture**
- **Definition**: Female ceases movement and adopts a low, stationary posture.
- **Description**: The female remains still with legs tucked or slightly extended, often lowering the abdomen.
- **Modality**: Behavioral.
- **Function**: Indicates receptivity; reduces risk of male predation.
- **Notes**: Males often escalate display intensity upon observing this posture.

### 9. **Orientation and Leg-Raising**
- **Definition**: Female turns toward the male and may raise front legs.
- **Description**: May indicate curiosity, receptivity, or aggression depending on context.
- **Function**: Ambiguous; context-dependent.
- **Notes**: Must be interpreted alongside other behaviors.

### 10. **Lunging or Retreating**
- **Definition**: Female moves rapidly toward or away from the male.
- **Description**: Lunging may be a threat or prelude to attack; retreating often follows aversive stimulus or lack of interest.
- **Function**: Aggression or rejection.
- **Notes**: Can terminate courtship; males often retreat or freeze in response.

---

## **IV. Copulatory Behavior**

### 11. **Mounting**
- **Definition**: Male climbs onto the dorsum of the female.
- **Description**: After female receptivity is indicated, the male approaches from behind or side and mounts the female.
- **Modality**: Tactile.
- **Function**: Positions male for copulation.
- **Notes**: Typically preceded by brief palp grooming and cessation of display.

### 12. **Palpal Insertion**
- **Definition**: Insertion of male pedipalp into female epigynum.
- **Description**: The male aligns one pedipalp with the female's genital opening and performs one or more insertions.
- **Modality**: Tactile.
- **Function**: Sperm transfer.
- **Notes**: Alternating insertions of right and left pedipalps may occur; duration and number of insertions vary.

---

## **V. Post-Copulatory Behavior**

### 13. **Disengagement and Retreat**
- **Definition**: Male dismounts and moves away from the female.
- **Description**: Males carefully retreat to avoid post-copulatory aggression.
- **Function**: Reduces risk of cannibalism or injury.
- **Notes**: Females may remain stationary or become aggressive; rapid retreat is common.

---

## **Conclusion**

The courtship of *Phidippus audax* is a complex, multimodal process involving a sequence of stereotyped yet flexible behaviors. Successful mating depends on male ability to effectively signal via visual and vibratory channels while modulating behavior in response to female feedback. The integration of these cues reflects the high degree of sensory sophistication in Salticids and underscores the importance of behavioral plasticity in mating success.

Prompt 3: Please compare courtship in Phidippus audex with that of spiders in the genus Habronattus.

Response:

Comparing courtship behavior in *Phidippus audax* with that of spiders in the genus *Habronattus* reveals both shared evolutionary traits typical of Salticidae (jumping spiders) and significant divergences, particularly in the complexity and function of multimodal signaling. The comparison is particularly relevant for understanding sexual selection, communication evolution, and signal integration in arthropods.

Below is a detailed, graduate-level comparison of courtship behavior in *Phidippus audax* and *Habronattus* spp., focusing on modality, behavioral components, signal complexity, and evolutionary contexts.

---

## **I. Taxonomic and Ecological Context**

| Characteristic | *Phidippus audax* | *Habronattus* spp. |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Family | Salticidae (Jumping spiders) | Salticidae (Jumping spiders) |
| Distribution | Widespread across North America | Primarily North and Central America |
| Habitat | Generalist; grasslands, urban, forest edges | Often xeric habitats; ground-dwelling |
| Size | Relatively large | Small to medium-sized |
| Sexual Dimorphism | Moderate (larger females, darker males) | Often extreme; males are brightly colored |

---

## **II. **Modality and Signal Types in Courtship**

### **1. Visual Signaling**

#### ***Phidippus audax***
- **Primary visual signals**: Leg-waving, body swaying, and orientation.
- **Coloration**: Males have iridescent chelicerae (green-blue), but less elaborate body coloration.
- **Function**: Visual displays help maintain female attention and reduce aggression.
- **Complexity**: Moderate; displays are stereotyped but adaptable to female response.

#### ***Habronattus* spp.**
- **Primary visual signals**: Highly choreographed leg- and body-movements, ornament displays (e.g., colored faces, fringed legs), and “dances” involving precise motor patterns.
- **Coloration**: Males often have vivid, species-specific ornamentation (red, blue, UV-reflective structures).
- **Function**: Visual signals play a dominant role in female mate choice.
- **Complexity**: High; visual display is species-specific and often under strong sexual selection.

> **Summary**: *Habronattus* displays are far more elaborate and diversified than those of *P. audax*, likely reflecting stronger sexual selection on visual traits.

---

### **2. Vibratory (Seismic) Signaling**

#### ***Phidippus audax***
- **Sources**: Palpal drumming, abdominal bouncing.
- **Medium**: Substrate-borne (through the ground or plant surfaces).
- **Function**: Complements visual signals; may play a role in species recognition and female receptivity.
- **Signal structure**: Simple, pulsatile patterns.

#### ***Habronattus* spp.**
- **Sources**: Cephalothorax tremulations, palpal taps, leg thumps.
- **Medium**: Substrate-borne vibrations.
- **Function**: Crucial in female receptivity and species identification; often temporally coordinated with visual signals.
- **Signal structure**: Highly species-specific and complex, including frequency-modulated pulses and patterned rhythms.

> **Summary**: While both genera use vibratory signals, *Habronattus* exhibits significantly greater diversity and complexity in seismic courtship, often with tight coordination to visual cues (multimodal matching).

---

### **3. Multimodal Signal Integration**

#### ***Phidippus audax***
- **Integration**: Sequential or loosely coupled; male may shift between visual and vibratory modes depending on female behavior.
- **Cognitive load**: Likely moderate; some evidence of female preference for multimodality, but less fine-tuned integration.

#### ***Habronattus* spp.**
- **Integration**: Highly integrated; visual and vibratory signals are temporally and structurally linked.
- **Cognitive load**: High; females assess multiple traits simultaneously (color, motion, vibratory rhythm).
- **Empirical support**: Studies show that removing one modality can significantly reduce mating success.

> **Summary**: *Habronattus* courtship is a textbook example of **multimodal signal integration**, where both channels are essential and co-evolved. *P. audax* is more flexible and sequential in modality use.

---

## **III. Behavioral Repertoire**

| Behavior | *Phidippus audax* | *Habronattus* spp. |
|----------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Leg waving | Yes (moderate) | Yes (highly choreographed) |
| Body swaying | Yes | Yes |
| Palpal drumming | Yes | Yes (more complex) |
| Abdominal bouncing | Yes | Yes |
| Ornament display | Minimal (chelicerae) | Extensive (face, legs, abdomen) |
| Species-specific “dances” | No | Yes |

---

## **IV. Female Response and Mate Choice**

### ***Phidippus audax***
- **Female behavior**: Stationary posture, leg raising, or retreat.
- **Mate choice**: Relatively less selective; female aggression is a major barrier.
- **Sexual cannibalism**: Common if male fails to signal effectively.

### ***Habronattus* spp.**
- **Female behavior**: Active assessment; oriented watching and tracking of male display.
- **Mate choice**: Highly selective; females prefer specific visual and vibratory patterns.
- **Sexual cannibalism**: Less common; females often allow prolonged display.

> **Summary**: *Habronattus* females are more behaviorally engaged in the courtship process and exert greater selective pressure on male display traits.

---

## **V. Evolutionary Considerations**

### **Sexual Selection Pressure**
- **P. audax**: Displays are under moderate sexual selection; emphasis on avoiding predation and eliciting receptivity.
- **Habronattus**: Displays are under intense sexual selection; male traits evolve rapidly and show strong divergence among species.

### **Signal Evolution**
- **P. audax**: Signals are relatively conserved across populations.
- **Habronattus**: Rapid diversification of both visual and seismic traits; used in phylogenetic analyses and species delimitation.

---

## **Conclusion**

| Feature | *Phidippus audax* | *Habronattus* spp. |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Signal complexity | Moderate | High |
| Ornamentation | Minimal | Extensive |
| Visual-vibratory integration | Loose | Tight |
| Female selectivity | Moderate | High |
| Courtship duration | Short to moderate | Often prolonged |
| Role of sexual selection | Moderate | Strong and divergent |

In summary, while *Phidippus audax* and *Habronattus* both exemplify the salticid reliance on visual and vibratory courtship, *Habronattus* has evolved an exceptionally elaborate and integrated multimodal system—a model for studying sexual selection, signal evolution, and cognitive ecology. *P. audax*, by contrast, represents a more generalized courtship pattern with less ornamentation and simpler signal integration, potentially reflecting differences in ecological pressures, predation risk, or mating systems.
