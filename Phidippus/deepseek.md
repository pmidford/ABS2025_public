Prompt 1: Write me an ethogram of courtship in Phidippus audex.  Please be as detailed as possible and assume a graduate student level audience.

Response:

Certainly! Below is a detailed ethogram of courtship behavior in *Phidippus audax* (the bold jumping spider), written for a graduate-level audience. This ethogram is based on empirical studies of salticid spider courtship, with *P. audax* being a well-documented species due to its complex visual displays.

---

### **Ethogram of Courtship Behavior in *Phidippus audax***  

#### **1. Initial Detection and Orientation**  
- **Visual Fixation**: The male orients his anterior median eyes (principal eyes) toward the female, assessing her size, movement, and receptivity.  
- **Approach Initiation**: If the female is stationary or displaying receptive cues (e.g., lack of aggression, slow movements), the male begins a cautious approach, often pausing intermittently.  

#### **2. Male Courtship Displays**  
Courtship in *P. audax* is multimodal, incorporating visual, vibratory, and tactile signals.  

##### **A. Visual Displays**  
- **Pedipalp Waving**: The male raises and rapidly waves his pedipalps in a rhythmic motion, likely displaying their white or iridescent setae.  
- **Leg I (First Pair) Displays**:  
  - **Extended Leg Raise**: The male lifts his first pair of legs (Leg I) high, displaying their bold black-and-white banding.  
  - **Pulsing Movements**: The legs may be moved in a slow, pulsating manner, enhancing visibility.  
- **Body Bounces (Seismic Component)**: The male performs small, vertical bounces, possibly generating substrate vibrations.  

##### **B. Vibratory Signals**  
- **Abdomen Drumming**: The male taps his abdomen against the substrate, producing low-frequency vibrations detectable by the female’s mechanosensory organs.  
- **Stridulation (if present)**: Some *Phidippus* species may produce faint stridulatory sounds via cheliceral movement, though this is less documented in *P. audax*.  

##### **C. Tactile Cues (Proximate Phase)**  
- **Tiptoe Approach**: The male advances slowly, minimizing sudden movements that might trigger aggression.  
- **Antenna-like Leg Testing**: The male may extend Leg I to gently touch the female, assessing her receptivity before mounting.  

#### **3. Female Responses**  
Female *P. audax* exhibit a range of responses that dictate whether courtship proceeds:  
- **Receptive Signals**:  
  - **Freezing**: The female remains motionless, allowing the male to approach.  
  - **Pedipalp Flicking**: Subtle movements may indicate interest.  
  - **Submissive Posture**: Lowering the body and retracting legs slightly.  
- **Aggressive/Rejective Signals**:  
  - **Lunging or Striking**: The female may attack if unreceptive.  
  - **Rapid Retreat**: Moving away abruptly.  

#### **4. Copulation Sequence**  
If the female is receptive:  
- **Mounting**: The male carefully climbs onto the female’s dorsum, aligning his genital opening (epigyne) with hers.  
- **Sperm Transfer**: The male inserts his pedipalps (charged with sperm) into the female’s epigyne in a series of brief insertions.  
- **Post-Copulatory Behavior**:  
  - **Rapid Disengagement**: Males often retreat quickly to avoid cannibalism.  
  - **Female Refractory Period**: The female may become temporarily unreceptive to further mating attempts.  

#### **5. Variations and Contextual Factors**  
- **Light Conditions**: Visual displays are more pronounced in well-lit environments.  
- **Female Mating History**: Virgin females may be more receptive than mated females.  
- **Male Competition**: In the presence of rival males, courtship may escalate in intensity or be truncated to avoid interference.  

#### **6. Potential Aberrant Behaviors**  
- **Premature Approaches**: Males misjudging female receptivity may trigger aggression.  
- **Incomplete Transfers**: Failed sperm transfer due to female movement or male error.  
- **Cannibalism**: Females may attack males before, during, or after mating (though less common in *P. audax* than in some other spiders).  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The courtship of *Phidippus audax* is a highly ritualized, multimodal process that integrates visual, vibratory, and tactile signals to ensure successful mating while minimizing predation risk. Future research could explore the neuroethological mechanisms behind female choice and the role of environmental factors in modulating display efficacy.  

Would you like any additional details on specific behaviors or experimental methodologies used to study them?

Prompt 3: Please compare courtship in Phidippus audex with that of spiders in the genus Habronattus.

Response:

Certainly! Below is a detailed comparison of courtship behaviors in *Phidippus audax* (bold jumping spider) and spiders in the genus *Habronattus*, focusing on their multimodal signaling strategies, evolutionary adaptations, and ecological contexts.  

---

### **Comparison of Courtship in *Phidippus audax* vs. *Habronattus***  

#### **1. Sensory Modalities and Signal Complexity**  
| Feature               | *Phidippus audax*                          | *Habronattus* spp.                          |  
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|  
| **Primary Modality**  | **Visual** (dominant)                     | **Multimodal** (visual + vibrational + auditory) |  
| **Visual Displays**   | Pedipalp waving, leg I extensions, body bounces | Complex color displays (UV-reflective patches, iridescence) |  
| **Vibratory Signals** | Substrate tapping (abdomen drumming)      | **Highly elaborate** (species-specific "songs" via leg/femur stridulation) |  
| **Auditory Signals**  | Minimal (if any)                          | **Present** (e.g., *H. coecatus* produces airborne sounds via abdomen clicks) |  

**Key Difference:**  
- *Habronattus* has evolved **far more complex vibrational/acoustic signals**, likely due to sexual selection pressures for species-specific recognition in sympatric communities (Elias et al. 2012).  
- *P. audax* relies more on **visual acuity** (e.g., bold black-and-white leg banding) and simpler vibrations.  

---

#### **2. Visual Displays and Ornamentation**  
| Feature               | *Phidippus audax*                          | *Habronattus* spp.                          |  
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|  
| **Color Use**         | High-contrast black/white leg bands       | **Polychromatic**: UV-reflective facial/leg scales (e.g., *H. pyrrithrix*’s red face) |  
| **Dynamic Displays**  | Pedipalp flicking, leg waving              | **"Dancing"**: Rapid leg-tapping sequences synchronized with vibrations |  
| **Female Choice Cues** | Female assesses male size/movement speed  | Females prefer **specific color patterns + song rhythms** (Taylor & McGraw 2013) |  

**Key Difference:**  
- *Habronattus* males use **ornamentation as honest signals** (e.g., bright colors correlate with health).  
- *P. audax* prioritizes **movement precision** (e.g., slow approaches to avoid triggering aggression).  

---

#### **3. Vibratory Communication**  
| Feature               | *Phidippus audax*                          | *Habronattus* spp.                          |  
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|  
| **Vibration Production** | Abdomen drumming on substrate           | **Stridulation**: Scraping legs against abdomen or other body parts |  
| **Signal Complexity** | Simple, repetitive pulses                | **Structured "songs"**: Rhythmic patterns with distinct syllables |  
| **Function**          | Basic mate attraction/coordination        | **Species isolation**: Females discriminate based on song structure |  

**Key Difference:**  
- *Habronattus* vibrations are **species-specific**, functioning like bird songs (Elias & Mason 2014).  
- *P. audax* vibrations are **ancestral and generalized**, lacking fine-tuned variation.  

---

#### **4. Female Responses and Sexual Selection**  
| Feature               | *Phidippus audax*                          | *Habronattus* spp.                          |  
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|  
| **Receptivity Cues**  | Freezing, pedipalp flicking               | **Active assessment**: Females "test" males with reciprocal vibrations |  
| **Cannibalism Risk**  | Moderate (males retreat post-copulation)  | **Higher**: Females often attack males mid-display if unimpressed |  
| **Polyandry**         | Rare (females mate once or twice)         | **Common**: Females may accept multiple males, favoring best performers |  

**Key Difference:**  
- *Habronattus* females exert **stronger sexual selection**, driving male signal diversification.  
- *P. audax* courtship is **more ritualized and conservative**, with fewer female rejections.  

---

#### **5. Evolutionary and Ecological Drivers**  
| Factor                | *Phidippus audax*                          | *Habronattus* spp.                          |  
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|  
| **Habitat**           | Open fields, human-disturbed areas        | **Arid/rocky environments** (enhances vibrational transmission) |  
| **Sympatry**          | Few congeners overlap                    | **High sympatry**: Many *Habronattus* species coexist, requiring signal divergence |  
| **Selection Pressure** | Predator avoidance (crypsis)             | **Sexual selection** (female choice drives signal complexity) |  

**Key Difference:**  
- *Habronattus*’s **acoustic-vibratory arms race** mirrors frog/bird communication systems.  
- *P. audax*’s **visual focus** aligns with its high-light habitat and solitary lifestyle.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
While both genera use multimodal courtship, *Habronattus* has evolved **greater complexity in vibrational/acoustic signals** due to intense sexual selection and sympatric speciation. In contrast, *P. audax* relies on **visual prowess**, reflecting its ecological niche as a bold, generalist predator.  

**Future Research Directions:**  
- Neuroethology of *Habronattus* song discrimination vs. *Phidippus* motion detection.  
- Role of UV reflectance in *Habronattus* female choice (understudied in *P. audax*).  

Would you like a similar comparison with another salticid genus (e.g., *Portia* or *Salticus*)?
