Response:

**Ethogram of Courtship in *Phidippus audax* (Bold Jumping Spider)**

**Introduction**

*Phidippus audax* is a common jumping spider known for its distinctive courtship displays. This ethogram describes the courtship behavior of *P. audax* in detail, assuming a graduate student level of understanding in animal behavior and arachnology.

**Courtship Sequence**

1. **Mate Search**
   - **Perambulation:** Males actively search for females by moving through the environment. They use their keen vision and sensory hairs to detect chemical and visual cues indicating the presence of a female.

2. **Initial Contact**
   - **Visual Detection:** Upon spotting a female, the male orients himself towards her. Visual cues, such as the female's size and posture, are crucial in this stage.
   - **Chemotactic Response:** The male may also respond to chemical cues, such as pheromones, deposited by the female on the substrate.

3. **Approach**
   - **Cautious Advance:** The male approaches the female slowly and cautiously, often in a zigzag pattern. This behavior helps to avoid being mistaken for prey and reduces the risk of a predatory response from the female.

4. **Courtship Display**
   - **Leg Waving:** The male raises his first pair of legs and waves them in a semi-circular motion. This display is often accompanied by slight body vibrations.
   - **Abdomen Bobbing:** The male bobs his abdomen up and down rhythmically. This movement is thought to enhance the visual signal of the leg-waving display.
   - **Palp Drumming:** The male uses his pedipalps to drum on the substrate, producing vibrations that can be detected by the female.
   - **Body Tilting:** The male tilts his body from side to side, often in synchrony with the leg-waving and abdomen-bobbing movements.

5. **Female Response**
   - **Receptivity Signals:** A receptive female may remain stationary or move slightly, indicating her willingness to mate.
   - **Rejection Signals:** An unreceptive female may move away, adopt a threatening posture, or even attack the male.

6. **Copulation Attempt**
   - **Palp Insertion:** If the female is receptive, the male attempts to insert one of his pedipalps into the female's epigynum. Successful insertion leads to sperm transfer.
   - **Copulatory Embrace:** The male and female may remain in a copulatory embrace for several seconds to minutes, during which sperm transfer occurs.

7. **Post-Copulatory Behavior**
   - **Guard Mating:** The male may remain near the female after copulation to guard her from other males and ensure paternity.
   - **Retreat:** The male may retreat from the female to avoid post-copulatory cannibalism, which is rare but possible in *P. audax*.

**Variability and Context-Dependence**

The courtship sequence described above is a generalized account and may vary based on individual differences, environmental conditions, and social context. For example, the intensity and duration of courtship displays can be influenced by the presence of rival males or the reproductive state of the female.

**Functional Significance**

The elaborate courtship displays of *P. audax* serve multiple functions, including species recognition, assessment of mate quality, and synchronization of reproductive behaviors. These displays are likely shaped by sexual selection, with males competing to attract and secure mates.

**Conclusion**

The courtship behavior of *Phidippus audax* is a complex and dynamic process involving a suite of visual and vibratory signals. Understanding this behavior provides insights into the evolution of communication systems, sexual selection, and the sensory ecology of jumping spiders.

Prompt 3: Please compare courtship in Phidippus audex with that of spiders in the genus Habronattus.

Response:

Comparing the courtship behavior of *Phidippus audax* with that of spiders in the genus *Habronattus* reveals both similarities and differences in their display repertoires and communication strategies. Both genera belong to the family Salticidae (jumping spiders), but they have evolved distinct courtship behaviors due to different selective pressures and ecological contexts. Here's a detailed comparison:

### Visual Displays

**Phidippus audax:**
- **Leg Waving and Body Bobbing:** Males perform rhythmic leg waving and body bobbing displays to attract the female's attention. These displays are visually striking and often involve the brightly colored third pair of legs.
- **Jerking Display:** The male performs rapid, jerky movements with his entire body, interspersed with periods of stillness.
- **Pedipalp Display:** The male extends and waves his pedipalps vigorously, which are used to transfer sperm during copulation.

**Habronattus spp.:**
- **Complex Leg and Body Movements:** *Habronattus* males exhibit intricate and often elaborate leg and body movements, including zigzag dances, leg waving, and body bobbing. These displays are highly variable and species-specific.
- **Ornamental Structures:** Many *Habronattus* species have evolved ornamental structures on their third pair of legs, which are used in visual displays. These structures can include tufts of brightly colored hairs or modified leg segments.
- **Fan Display:** Some *Habronattus* species, such as *H. clypeatus*, perform a fan display where the male raises his third pair of legs to form a fan-like structure, which is waved in front of the female.

### Seismic Communication

**Phidippus audax:**
- **Substrate-Borne Signals:** Males produce vibrations through the substrate using their pedipalps and legs. These seismic signals are thought to complement visual displays and provide additional information to the female.

**Habronattus spp.:**
- **Complex Seismic Signals:** *Habronattus* males generate a wide variety of substrate-borne signals, including buzzes, scratches, and raps. These signals are often species-specific and can convey information about the male's quality and intent.
- **Multimodal Communication:** *Habronattus* species are known for their multimodal communication strategies, integrating visual and seismic signals to create a complex courtship display. This multimodal approach enhances the effectiveness of courtship by engaging multiple sensory modalities of the female.

### Courtship Duration and Intensity

**Phidippus audax:**
- **Relatively Short Displays:** The courtship displays of *Phidippus audax* are generally shorter and less intense compared to those of *Habronattus*. The male's displays are designed to attract the female's attention quickly and assess her receptiveness.

**Habronattus spp.:**
- **Prolonged and Intense Displays:** *Habronattus* males often perform prolonged and highly intense courtship displays. These displays can last for several minutes and involve a series of elaborate movements and signals. The intensity and duration of these displays are thought to be indicative of the male's fitness and quality.

### Female Response

**Phidippus audax:**
- **Receptiveness Assessment:** Females assess the male's displays and may respond with acceptance or rejection. Acceptance is indicated by remaining still, while rejection may involve moving away or adopting a defensive posture.

**Habronattus spp.:**
- **Active Participation:** Females of some *Habronattus* species actively participate in the courtship process. They may respond to the male's displays with their own movements or signals, creating a dynamic interaction between the two.

### Evolutionary Context

**Phidippus audax:**
- **Generalist Strategy:** The courtship behavior of *Phidippus audax* reflects a more generalist strategy, with displays that are effective across a range of ecological contexts. This approach may be adaptive in environments where rapid assessment and decision-making are crucial.

**Habronattus spp.:**
- **Specialist Strategy:** *Habronattus* species have evolved highly specialized courtship behaviors, often tailored to specific ecological niches. These specialized displays may enhance reproductive success in competitive or complex environments.

### Conclusion

The courtship behaviors of *Phidippus audax* and *Habronattus* species share some common elements, such as the use of visual and seismic signals, but they differ significantly in complexity, duration, and the incorporation of ornamental structures. *Habronattus* species exhibit more elaborate and prolonged displays, often involving multimodal communication strategies, while *Phidippus audax* employs a more streamlined and efficient courtship repertoire. Understanding these differences provides insights into the evolutionary pressures and adaptive strategies that shape mating behaviors in jumping spiders.
