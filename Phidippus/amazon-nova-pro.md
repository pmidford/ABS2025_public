### Ethogram of Courtship Behavior in *Phidippus audax*

#### 1. **Pre-Courtship Behaviors**

**1.1. Habitat Selection**
- **Description:** The male spider selects a suitable location, often near a female’s web or within her territory, to begin courtship.
- **Context:** This behavior is crucial for increasing the likelihood of encountering a receptive female.

**1.2. Vibration Signaling**
- **Description:** The male produces substrate-borne vibrations by drumming his pedipalps or legs on the substrate.
- **Context:** These vibrations serve to attract the female’s attention and signal the male’s presence.

#### 2. **Approach Behaviors**

**2.1. Cautious Approach**
- **Description:** The male slowly and cautiously approaches the female, often pausing and reassessing his position.
- **Context:** This behavior minimizes the risk of being perceived as a threat by the female.

**2.2. Orientation**
- **Description:** The male orients himself facing the female, ensuring direct visual and vibrational communication.
- **Context:** Proper orientation is essential for effective courtship signaling.

#### 3. **Courtship Display**

**3.1. Leg Waving**
- **Description:** The male raises and waves his first pair of legs in a rhythmic manner.
- **Context:** Leg waving is a visual display intended to capture the female’s attention and convey the male’s intentions.

**3.2. Pedipalp Presentation**
- **Description:** The male extends and displays his pedipalps, often accompanied by subtle movements.
- **Context:** Pedipalp presentation is a critical component of visual courtship, showcasing the male’s reproductive structures.

**3.3. Abdomen Vibrations**
- **Description:** The male vibrates his abdomen, producing both visual and substrate-borne signals.
- **Context:** This behavior enhances the multimodal nature of the courtship display, increasing its effectiveness.

#### 4. **Female Responses**

**4.1. Receptivity Signaling**
- **Description:** The female may respond with her own set of vibrations or by adopting a receptive posture.
- **Context:** Female receptivity signals indicate her willingness to engage in mating.

**4.2. Aggression**
- **Description:** The female may display aggressive behaviors, such as lunging or chasing the male away.
- **Context:** Aggressive responses can occur if the female is not receptive or feels threatened.

#### 5. **Mating Behaviors**

**5.1. Mounting**
- **Description:** The male climbs onto the female’s back, aligning his body for copulation.
- **Context:** Successful mounting is a precursor to sperm transfer.

**5.2. Sperm Transfer**
- **Description:** The male inserts his pedipalps into the female’s epigynum to transfer sperm.
- **Context:** This is the culmination of the courtship process, resulting in fertilization.

#### 6. **Post-Mating Behaviors**

**6.1. Dismounting**
- **Description:** The male carefully dismounts from the female’s back.
- **Context:** Dismounting must be done cautiously to avoid triggering aggressive behavior from the female.

**6.2. Retreat**
- **Description:** The male quickly retreats from the vicinity of the female.
- **Context:** Retreating reduces the risk of post-mating cannibalism by the female.

### Notes:
- **Multimodal Communication:** *Phidippus audax* relies on a combination of visual, vibrational, and possibly chemical signals during courtship.
- **Environmental Factors:** Courtship behaviors can be influenced by environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and substrate type.
- **Individual Variation:** There may be individual variations in the intensity and duration of courtship behaviors.

Prompt 3: Please compare courtship in Phidippus audex with that of spiders in the genus Habronattus.

Response:

Certainly! Both *Phidippus audax* and spiders in the genus *Habronattus* are salticid spiders, but they exhibit distinct courtship behaviors due to differences in their evolutionary histories, ecological niches, and species-specific traits. Below is a comparison of courtship behaviors between these two genera:

### Courtship Behaviors in *Phidippus audax*

1. **Pre-Courtship Behaviors:**
   - **Habitat Selection:** Males select a location near a female’s web.
   - **Vibration Signaling:** Males produce substrate-borne vibrations to attract females.

2. **Approach Behaviors:**
   - **Cautious Approach:** Males approach females slowly and cautiously.
   - **Orientation:** Males face females directly for communication.

3. **Courtship Display:**
   - **Leg Waving:** Males raise and wave their first pair of legs.
   - **Pedipalp Presentation:** Males extend and display their pedipalps.
   - **Abdomen Vibrations:** Males vibrate their abdomens to produce signals.

4. **Female Responses:**
   - **Receptivity Signaling:** Females may respond with vibrations or adopt a receptive posture.
   - **Aggression:** Females may display aggressive behaviors if not receptive.

5. **Mating Behaviors:**
   - **Mounting:** Males climb onto females’ backs.
   - **Sperm Transfer:** Males insert pedipalps into females’ epigynum.

6. **Post-Mating Behaviors:**
   - **Dismounting:** Males carefully dismount.
   - **Retreat:** Males quickly retreat to avoid aggression.

### Courtship Behaviors in *Habronattus* spp.

1. **Pre-Courtship Behaviors:**
   - **Habitat Selection:** Males often select prominent locations, such as elevated perches, to increase visibility.
   - **Vibration Signaling:** Males use substrate-borne vibrations, but these are often species-specific and more complex.

2. **Approach Behaviors:**
   - **Cautious Approach:** Males approach females cautiously, but some species may be more bold.
   - **Orientation:** Males face females directly, but some species may use lateral displays.

3. **Courtship Display:**
   - **Leg Waving:** Males in *Habronattus* often perform elaborate leg-waving displays, which can include species-specific patterns.
   - **Pedipalp Presentation:** Males extend pedipalps, but the display may be more exaggerated and species-specific.
   - **Abdomen Vibrations:** Males may vibrate their abdomens, but this is often combined with other visual displays.

4. **Female Responses:**
   - **Receptivity Signaling:** Females may respond with species-specific vibrations or postures.
   - **Aggression:** Females may be more aggressive, and species-specific signals are crucial for mate recognition.

5. **Mating Behaviors:**
   - **Mounting:** Males climb onto females’ backs, but the process may be more rapid in some species.
   - **Sperm Transfer:** Males insert pedipalps, but the duration and mechanics may vary by species.

6. **Post-Mating Behaviors:**
   - **Dismounting:** Males dismount carefully, but some species may exhibit more rapid retreat.
   - **Retreat:** Males retreat quickly, often using pre-planned escape routes.

### Key Differences

- **Complexity of Displays:** *Habronattus* species often have more elaborate and species-specific courtship displays compared to *Phidippus audax*.
- **Use of Perching:** *Habronattus* males frequently use elevated perches to increase visibility during courtship, whereas *Phidippus audax* males may not rely as heavily on perching.
- **Species-Specific Signals:** Courtship behaviors in *Habronattus* are highly species-specific, with distinct vibrational and visual signals for each species, whereas *Phidippus audax* displays are more generalized.
- **Aggressiveness:** Females in *Habronattus* may exhibit higher levels of aggression, necessitating more precise courtship signals from males.

### Conclusion

While both genera exhibit complex courtship behaviors, *Habronattus* species tend to have more elaborate and species-specific displays, likely driven by the need for precise mate recognition in a diverse genus. In contrast, *Phidippus audax* displays are relatively generalized, reflecting a broader approach to courtship within its ecological niche.
