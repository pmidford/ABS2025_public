Response:

**Ethogram of Courtship Behavior in Schizocosa ocreata (Brush-legged Wolf Spider)**

**Introduction**

*Schizocosa ocreata* (Hentz, 1844), commonly known as the brush-legged wolf spider, exhibits a complex courtship behavior that involves a combination of visual, vibratory, and chemical signals. This ethogram describes the courtship behavior in detail, assuming a graduate student level audience familiar with basic arachnid biology and behavioral ecology.

**Courtship Sequence**

1. **Mate Search**
   - Males wander in search of females, tapping the substrate with their pedipalps and first pair of legs to detect chemical and vibratory cues.
   - Males can detect silk draglines and pheromones left by females.

2. **Initial Contact**
   - Upon detecting a female, the male approaches cautiously, keeping a safe distance to avoid being attacked.
   - The male begins to produce low-amplitude vibrations with his pedipalps and legs, which travel through the substrate.

3. **Visual Display**
   - The male raises his forelegs and waves them in a species-specific pattern. This display consists of two main components:
     - **Leg-lifting**: The male lifts his first pair of legs high above his body, exposing the black and white markings on the ventral side of his femora.
     - **Leg-waving**: The male waves his lifted legs in an arc-like motion, moving them up and down and from side to side.
   - The visual display is accompanied by continuous vibratory signals produced by the male's pedipalps and legs.

4. **Chemical Signaling**
   - The male deposits silk and pheromones onto the substrate during his display, creating a chemical trail that the female can detect.
   - The male may also rub his pedipalps on the substrate, releasing additional pheromones.

5. **Female Response**
   - Receptive females remain stationary and lower their bodies, indicating acceptance of the male's courtship efforts.
   - Unreceptive females may move away, adopt a threat posture (raising their forelegs and opening their chelicerae), or attack the male.

6. **Copulation**
   - If the female is receptive, the male approaches her slowly and carefully, continually producing vibratory signals.
   - The male climbs onto the female's back, positioning himself for copulation.
   - The male inserts one of his pedipalps into the female's epigynum, transferring sperm.
   - Copulation lasts for 5-30 seconds, after which the male quickly dismounts and moves away to avoid being attacked by the female.

**Variations and Strategies**

- Males may adjust their courtship behavior based on the presence of rival males or the perceived receptivity of the female.
- In the presence of rival males, courtship bouts may be more vigorous and prolonged, a behavior known as "mate guarding."
- Males may also engage in "sneaker" tactics, attempting to copulate with females without performing the full courtship display when rival males are present.

**Quantifying Courtship Behavior**

To quantify courtship behavior, the following metrics can be used:

- Duration of each courtship component (e.g., leg-lifting, leg-waving, vibratory signaling)
- Frequency of leg-waving and vibratory signals
- Latency to copulation (time from initial contact to copulation)
- Copulation duration
- Female response (acceptance, rejection, or aggression)
- Presence and intensity of male-male competition

**Conclusion**

The courtship behavior of *Schizocosa ocreata* is a complex, multimodal display involving visual, vibratory, and chemical signals. Understanding this behavior provides insights into sexual selection, communication, and the evolution of signaling systems in arachnids. Further research may focus on the role of male-male competition, female choice, and the proximate and ultimate factors driving the evolution of courtship behavior in this species.

Prompt 3:

Please compare courtship in Schizocosa ocreata with that of spiders in the genus Lycosa.

Response:

Comparing the courtship behavior of *Schizocosa ocreata* with that of spiders in the genus *Lycosa* reveals both similarities and differences, reflecting their shared evolutionary history as well as adaptations to specific ecological and social contexts. Below is a detailed comparison focusing on key aspects of courtship behavior:

### **Visual Displays**

**Schizocosa ocreata:**
- Males perform elaborate visual displays involving leg-lifting and leg-waving.
- The leg-waving display consists of raising the forelegs and moving them in an arc-like motion, exposing distinct markings on the ventral side of the femora.
- These displays are often accompanied by vibratory signals produced by the pedipalps and legs.

**Lycosa spp.:**
- Visual displays are generally less elaborate compared to *Schizocosa ocreata*.
- Males may perform leg-waving displays, but these are typically simpler and less pronounced.
- The visual component is often less critical, with more emphasis on vibratory and chemical signals.

### **Vibratory Signals**

**Schizocosa ocreata:**
- Males produce low-amplitude vibrations with their pedipalps and legs, which travel through the substrate.
- Vibratory signals are an integral part of the courtship display and are used in conjunction with visual and chemical signals.

**Lycosa spp.:**
- Vibratory signals play a crucial role in courtship, often more so than visual displays.
- Males produce substrate-borne vibrations using their pedipalps and legs, which are essential for communicating with females.
- The vibratory component can be more elaborate and varied, with different species having unique vibratory patterns.

### **Chemical Signaling**

**Schizocosa ocreata:**
- Males deposit silk and pheromones onto the substrate during their display, creating a chemical trail.
- Pheromones are released by rubbing pedipalps on the substrate, enhancing the multimodal nature of the courtship display.

**Lycosa spp.:**
- Chemical signaling is also important, with males depositing silk and pheromones.
- The chemical signals are often used in combination with vibratory signals to attract and communicate with females.
- The reliance on chemical cues can vary among species within the genus *Lycosa*.

### **Female Response**

**Schizocosa ocreata:**
- Receptive females remain stationary and lower their bodies, indicating acceptance.
- Unreceptive females may move away, adopt a threat posture, or attack the male.

**Lycosa spp.:**
- Female responses are similar, with receptive females remaining stationary and lowering their bodies.
- Unreceptive females may also move away, adopt a threat posture, or attack the male.
- The level of aggression can vary among species, with some *Lycosa* females being more aggressive towards courting males.

### **Copulation**

**Schizocosa ocreata:**
- Copulation is relatively brief, lasting 5-30 seconds.
- The male carefully approaches the female, continually producing vibratory signals, and climbs onto her back for copulation.

**Lycosa spp.:**
- Copulation duration can vary among species but is generally brief.
- The male approaches the female cautiously, producing vibratory signals, and positions himself for copulation.
- The copulatory behavior is similar, with the male inserting his pedipalps into the female's epigynum to transfer sperm.

### **Adaptive Strategies**

**Schizocosa ocreata:**
- Males may adjust their courtship behavior based on the presence of rival males or the perceived receptivity of the female.
- "Mate guarding" and "sneaker" tactics are observed in competitive situations.

**Lycosa spp.:**
- Similar adaptive strategies are observed, with males adjusting their behavior based on competition and female receptivity.
- Male-male competition can be intense, leading to more aggressive courtship displays and mate guarding.

### **Conclusion**

While *Schizocosa ocreata* and *Lycosa* spp. share many aspects of courtship behavior, such as the use of vibratory and chemical signals, there are notable differences in the complexity and emphasis of visual displays. *Schizocosa ocreata* males perform more elaborate visual displays, whereas *Lycosa* spp. tend to rely more heavily on vibratory and chemical signals. These differences likely reflect adaptations to specific ecological and social environments, as well as the evolutionary history of each genus. Further comparative studies could provide deeper insights into the evolution and adaptive significance of these courtship behaviors.
